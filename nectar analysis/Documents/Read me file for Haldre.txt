Read me file for Haldre
December 17, 2016

A couple of notes:

1.	The R markdown files are in the same folder as the R scripts they came from, 
specifically “analysis,” “munging” and “figures”
2.	I haven’t had time to write up a word document with analysis sections from 
methods and results, with the figures.  Plan to do that tomorrow (Saturday.)
12/17 update: This is done.  There's both a doc file and a pdf.
3.	The “big questions” for the project are laid out in the draft intro to the manuscript, 
which I’ve included in the “documents” folder (Nectar paper v1.docx).  That intro is 
a work in progress, but should give you an idea of the context in which this study is 
happening.
