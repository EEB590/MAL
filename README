Notes from meeting with Adam June 8

revise Balsamroot vol, brix and mass models to include date random effect
BRIX ~ treatment * year +(1|plot/plant) + (1|year:date), data = balsboth
redo ls means analysis for these new models
redo model diagnostics for these models

in exploration, plot date by BRIX
plot(as.factor(balsam$date, balsam$BRIX) - shows high variablility among dates so need to add as random effect

Be careful about interpretation : when flowers are producing nectar, this is what we see...

revise Buckwheat models to incorporate quadrant random effect
BRIX ~ treatment * year +(1|plot/quadrant) + (1|year:date), data = buckboth
check to see if high variability among dates and if we need the year:date random effect
redo ls means for these new models
redo model diagnostics for these models

For presence/absence
data exploration
do ls means analysis
run model diagnostics
back-transform effects from logit scale
Think about: remove data points from end of season?
